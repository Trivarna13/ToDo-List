# ToDo-List
To-Do List App In JavaScript

This JavaScript project is a To-Do list application that allows users to create and manage their task list. Users can add new tasks by typing them into an input box and clicking the "Add" button to append the task to the list. Each task in the list can be marked as complete or incomplete by clicking on its name. Additionally, a close icon is provided to delete specific tasks from the list.

To enhance the user experience, the project utilizes Local Storage, a feature in web browsers that allows data to be stored locally. This means that even if the user closes and restarts the browser, their saved To-Do list will still be displayed when they revisit the application.
